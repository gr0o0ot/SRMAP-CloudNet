adding a compute node


1. open 
  vi answers.txt 
2.  in that files search exclude and exclude the previously installed servers and add new compute node into "config compute hosts."

after that

3. we need to set ups trust btw the new servers and copy the ip address to the host file so that each nodes can address each other.

ssh-copy-id -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub_root@compute2


4. run packstack --answer-file ~/answers.txt --timeout=3000

5. we need to disable the firewall in the controller service.
as the controler node cannot accept the connections.
 
 service iptables stop
 
6. for modification of local ip we need to:
  vi /etc/neutron/plugins/m12/openvsswitch_agent.ini
in that file change the local_ip 


7. system1 restart neutron ovsdb server neutron-openvswitch-agent
(after resarting the local ip adress gets stored)

8. till now the compute node installed but now it should be registerd with the openstack
openstack compute service list -- service nova-compute (in the controller node)


9.to discover the compute node 
su -s/bin/sh -c "nova-manage cell_v2 discover_hosts --verbose" nova
